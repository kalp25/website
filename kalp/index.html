        <h1>Terms and conditions</h1>
             Purchasing goods from Coffee Bean Shop Ltd you enter a legally binding agreement with us on the following terms. You should read and understand these terms because they affect your rights and liabilities.
            
            These terms describe the basis for purchase, by you and sale by us, of the products described on this website.
            
          <h2> DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION</h2>
             These terms the following words have the following meanings.
            
          <h3>Contract</h3>
            The contract for the sale and purchase of the Goods;
            
            <h3>Delivery Area</h3>
          We deliver across the United Kingdom. For deliveries outside the UK, please see our Delivery Information page or contact us
            
            <h3>Details of the order</h3>
            The quantity, quality and description of the Goods will be those set out in your order (if accepted by us). Orders are accepted at our sole discretion but are usually accepted if the Goods are available, the order reflects current pricing, you are located in the Delivery Area and your credit or account card is authorised for the transaction. The Goods that can be ordered via our website are available for sale outside of the United Kingdom.
            <h3 >Postage and Packaging</h3>
            Postage and Packaging is charged on all orders unless otherwise stated
            
            <h2 >PAYMENT TERMS</h2>
            We will charge your credit card account for payment upon receipt of order unless delivery cannot be fulfilled within 30 days. Items with a lead-time greater than 30 days will be charged up to 7 days prior to despatch. We accept no liability if a delivery is delayed because you did not give us the right payment details. If it is not possible to obtain full payment for the Goods from your account on delivery of the Goods to you, we can cancel the contract or suspend any further deliveries to you. This does not affect any other rights we may have. We will take all reasonable care to keep all information connected with your order secure but we cannot be held liable for any loss that you may suffer if a third party obtains unauthorised access to any data, including credit and account details you provide when accessing or ordering from this website, unless this is solely due to our negligence.
            
            <h2>DISCOUNTS</h2>
            Please be aware that all discount codes are only applicable to the purchase of bagged coffee (including our fortnightly 4 and 5 bag promo).  All Coffee Packs/Bundles, Starter Packs, Gifts, Consumables (such as filters etc) and non-coffee products are excluded.
            
            All discount codes are available from the time they are released and valid until the time specified in our newsletter and can not be applied for orders purchased outside this period.
            
            The "NEWBEANIE" discount is only available for new costumers and only on their first order.
            
            <h2>DELIVERY</h2>
            We will deliver the Goods to the address you specify for delivery in your order. If payment is made by card, goods must be sent to the address as shown on the cards statement. It is important that this address is accurate. All orders dispatched will require a signature on delivery. We will never leave items unless they have been signed for. We cannot accept any liability for any loss or damage to the Goods once they have been delivered and signed for. We will aim to deliver the Goods by the date quoted for delivery, but delivery times are not guaranteed. If delivery is delayed due to any cause beyond our reasonable control, the delivery date will be extended by a reasonable period and we will contact you to arrange an alternative time.
            
           <h2 >RISK AND OWNERSHIP</h2> 
            Risk of damage to or loss of the Goods passes to you at the time of delivery to you or, if you fail to take delivery at the agreed time, the time when we tried to deliver. You will only own the Goods once they have been successfully delivered and when we have received cleared payment in full.
            
            <h2>OPTIONS TO CANCEL</h2>
            By law, customers within the European Union have the right to a ‘cooling off period’ within 14 working days of their purchase being delivered.
            
            If you decide to return a non-perishable item to Coffee Bean Shop Ltd during this period, you will be entitled to a refund of the cost of the item and the delivery charge, but not the return charge.
            
            The 'cooling off period' does not apply to products that are custom made, personalised (ie. roasted to order coffee) or perishables.
            
            If you are however returning an item because it is damaged, faulty or in any way defective, Coffee Bean Shop Ltd will refund the delivery and return fee upon receipt of the goods. If your parcel is damaged, we will gladly replace it in return for a photo of the damage to enable us to review Royal Mail's practices
            
            <h2 >PRICING</h2>
            The prices for all products are clearly displayed on the website. If, however, an item is priced incorrectly, we will inform you of the correct price before proceeding with the contract.</ol></p>
